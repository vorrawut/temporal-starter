# Lesson 4 Complete Solution

This folder contains the complete solution for Lesson 4: HelloWorkflow - your first Temporal workflow and activity.

## What's Included

### Workflow Components
- `workflow/HelloWorkflow.kt` - Workflow interface with `@WorkflowInterface`
- `workflow/HelloWorkflowImpl.kt` - Workflow implementation that orchestrates the activity

### Activity Components  
- `activity/GreetingActivity.kt` - Activity interface with `@ActivityInterface`
- `activity/GreetingActivityImpl.kt` - Activity implementation with actual business logic

### Configuration & Infrastructure
- `config/TemporalConfig.kt` - Complete Temporal setup with worker registration
- `runner/HelloWorkflowRunner.kt` - CommandLineRunner that executes the workflow
- `TemporalBootcampApplication.kt` - Spring Boot main class

## How It Works

1. **Spring Boot starts** and initializes Temporal configuration
2. **Worker starts** and registers HelloWorkflow and GreetingActivity
3. **HelloWorkflowRunner executes** automatically via CommandLineRunner
4. **Workflow stub is created** with proper task queue and workflow ID  
5. **Workflow executes** and calls the GreetingActivity
6. **Activity generates** a greeting message
7. **Result is returned** and logged to console

## Running This Solution

1. **Start Temporal server**:
   ```bash
   temporal server start-dev
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun --args="--spring.main.sources=com.temporal.bootcamp.lesson4.TemporalBootcampApplication"
   ```

3. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Temporal worker started successfully for HelloWorkflow!
      Task Queue: lesson4-hello-queue
      Registered: HelloWorkflow, GreetingActivity
   üöÄ Running HelloWorkflow...
   ‚úÖ Workflow completed!
      Result: Hello, Temporal Learner! Welcome to Temporal workflows!
   üåê Check the Temporal Web UI at http://localhost:8233
   ```

## Verification

### In the Console
You should see successful workflow execution with the greeting message.

### In Temporal Web UI (http://localhost:8233)
1. **Workflows tab** - Shows your workflow execution
2. **Task Queues tab** - Shows `lesson4-hello-queue` with 1 worker
3. **Workers tab** - Shows your worker with registered capabilities

### Workflow Details in Web UI
- Workflow ID: `hello-workflow-{timestamp}`
- Status: Completed
- Execution timeline showing workflow and activity execution

## Key Learning Points

### Workflow vs Activity
- **Workflow (HelloWorkflowImpl)**: Orchestration logic, deterministic, can be replayed
- **Activity (GreetingActivityImpl)**: Business logic, can fail and retry, handles external calls

### Annotations
- `@WorkflowInterface` / `@WorkflowMethod` - Define workflow contracts
- `@ActivityInterface` / `@ActivityMethod` - Define activity contracts  
- `@Component` - Spring manages activity as a bean

### Configuration
- **Task Queue**: Named channel connecting workflow requests to workers
- **Activity Options**: Timeouts and retry policies
- **Worker Registration**: Must register both workflows and activities

### Execution Flow
1. Client creates workflow stub
2. Client calls workflow method
3. Temporal routes to appropriate worker
4. Worker executes workflow code
5. Workflow calls activity via stub
6. Worker executes activity code
7. Results flow back through the chain

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basic workflow and activity pattern, you're ready for more advanced concepts in the remaining lessons!
