### Core Concepts
- **Temporal fundamentals** and architecture patterns
- **Workflow and activity** design principles
- **Error handling and reliability** patterns
- **Advanced orchestration** with signals, queries, and child workflows
- **Production deployment** and operational best practices

### Practical Skills
- Building workflows with **Kotlin** and **Spring Boot**
- Implementing **retry logic** and **timeout handling**
- **Testing strategies** for distributed systems
- **Monitoring and observability** for production systems
- **Containerization and deployment** with Docker and Kubernetes
