# üéØ Temporal Loan Application Demo - Expected Results

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the expected behavior and results when running the Temporal Loan Application System demo. Use this as a reference to verify that the demo is working correctly and to understand what each component demonstrates.

## ‚úÖ Expected Demo Outcomes

### üöÄ **Successful Application Flow**

When you submit a valid loan application, you should observe:

#### **Step 1: Application Submission**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/loan/apply -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "userId": "user-123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phone": "+1-555-0123",
  "loanAmount": 25000,
  "purpose": "HOME_IMPROVEMENT",
  "annualIncome": 75000,
  "documents": ["ID_CARD", "INCOME_STATEMENT", "BANK_STATEMENT"]
}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "workflowId": "loan-app-user-123-1234567890",
  "status": "SUBMITTED",
  "message": "Your loan application has been submitted and is being processed"
}
```

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**
- ‚úÖ Workflow starts with unique ID
- ‚úÖ Application persisted in Temporal state
- ‚úÖ Worker picks up workflow execution
- ‚úÖ Document validation activity begins

#### **Step 2: Document Validation** (Lessons 5, 6, 8)
**Console Logs You Should See:**
```
INFO  DocumentValidationActivityImpl - Starting document validation for application loan-app-user-123-...
INFO  DocumentValidationActivityImpl - Document validation completed: valid=true
```

**Temporal Web UI:**
- Navigate to [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233)
- Find your workflow by ID
- See "DocumentValidationActivity" completed successfully

#### **Step 3: Risk Scoring with Retries** (Lessons 5, 8, 15)
**Console Logs You Should See:**
```
INFO  RiskScoringActivityImpl - Starting risk assessment for application loan-app-user-123-...
WARN  CreditBureauService - Simulating timeout on first call
INFO  RiskScoringActivityImpl - Credit score retrieved: 750
INFO  RiskScoringActivityImpl - Risk assessment completed: LOW
```

**What This Demonstrates:**
- ‚úÖ External API call simulation
- ‚úÖ Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ Recovery from temporary failures
- ‚úÖ Successful completion after retries

#### **Step 4: Manual Approval Wait** (Lessons 10, 11)
**Check Status API:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/loan/status/user-123
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "workflowId": "loan-app-user-123-1234567890",
  "status": "AWAITING_APPROVAL",
  "application": { ... },
  "riskAssessment": {
    "creditScore": 750,
    "riskLevel": "LOW",
    "debtToIncomeRatio": 0.25
  },
  "processingHistory": [
    "Application received for user user-123",
    "Starting document validation",
    "Document validation completed successfully",
    "Starting risk assessment",
    "Risk assessment completed: LOW",
    "Awaiting manual approval"
  ]
}
```

**What This Demonstrates:**
- ‚úÖ Workflow paused, waiting for external signal
- ‚úÖ Query methods returning real-time state
- ‚úÖ Complete processing history tracked
- ‚úÖ Workflow persists across time

#### **Step 5: Approval Signal** (Lesson 10)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/loan/approve/user-123 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "approvedBy": "manager-456",
  "notes": "Application meets all criteria"
}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Loan approved successfully",
  "workflowId": "loan-app-user-123-1234567890"
}
```

**Console Logs You Should See:**
```
INFO  LoanApplicationWorkflowImpl - Approval received from manager-456: Application meets all criteria
INFO  LoanDisbursementActivityImpl - Starting loan disbursement for application loan-app-user-123-...
INFO  BankService - Bank transfer successful: BNK-uuid-here
```

#### **Step 6: Loan Disbursement** (Lessons 9, 15)
**What This Demonstrates:**
- ‚úÖ Signal received and processed
- ‚úÖ Workflow continues execution
- ‚úÖ Bank API integration
- ‚úÖ Transaction processing

#### **Step 7: Notifications** (Lesson 15)
**Console Logs You Should See:**
```
INFO  EmailService - EMAIL SENT:
INFO  EmailService - To: john.doe@example.com
INFO  EmailService - Subject: Loan Disbursed Successfully! - loan-app-user-123-...
INFO  SmsService - SMS SENT:
INFO  SmsService - To: +1-555-0123
INFO  SmsService - Message: Your loan has been disbursed! Check your account for $25000...
```

#### **Step 8: Follow-up Workflow** (Lessons 12, 14)
**Console Logs You Should See:**
```
INFO  FollowUpWorkflowImpl - Starting follow-up workflow for application: loan-app-user-123-...
```

**Final Status Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/loan/status/user-123
```

**Expected Final Response:**
```json
{
  "workflowId": "loan-app-user-123-1234567890",
  "status": "DISBURSED",
  "message": "Status retrieved successfully"
}
```

## üîÑ **Retry and Failure Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: External Service Retries**
**What to Observe:**
- Credit bureau API calls fail initially
- Automatic retries with increasing delays
- Eventually succeeds and continues

**Expected Logs:**
```
WARN  CreditBureauService - Simulating timeout on first call
WARN  CreditBureauService - Simulating rate limiting on second call
INFO  CreditBureauService - Credit bureau response: score=750
```

### **Scenario 2: Bank Transfer Failures**
**What to Observe:**
- Bank transfer may fail occasionally
- Compensation logic kicks in
- Workflow handles failure gracefully

**Expected Logs:**
```
WARN  BankService - Simulating bank transfer failure
INFO  LoanDisbursementActivityImpl - Starting compensation for failed disbursement
```

## üîç **Observability Features**

### **Temporal Web UI Verification**
1. **Navigate to**: [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233)
2. **Find your workflow**: Search by workflow ID
3. **Inspect execution**: See complete event history
4. **View activities**: Check activity executions and retries

**What You Should See:**
- ‚úÖ Complete workflow execution timeline
- ‚úÖ Activity retry attempts
- ‚úÖ Signal events
- ‚úÖ Current workflow state
- ‚úÖ Input/output data for each activity

### **Application Health Checks**
```bash
# Application health
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

# Expected response
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "temporal": {"status": "UP"}
  }
}
```

### **Query API Verification**
```bash
# Real-time state query
curl http://localhost:8080/api/loan/query/user-123/state
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "workflowId": "loan-app-user-123-1234567890",
  "currentState": "DISBURSED",
  "applicationDetails": { ... },
  "riskAssessment": { ... },
  "processingHistory": [ ... ]
}
```

## üß™ **Testing Different Scenarios**

### **High-Risk Application (Auto-Rejection)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/loan/apply -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "userId": "high-risk-user",
  "firstName": "Bob",
  "lastName": "Wilson",
  "email": "bob.wilson.low@example.com",
  "annualIncome": 30000,
  "loanAmount": 100000,
  "documents": ["ID_CARD"]
}'
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ‚úÖ Workflow completes with "REJECTED" status
- ‚úÖ Risk assessment shows "VERY_HIGH" risk
- ‚úÖ No manual approval required
- ‚úÖ Rejection notification sent

### **Manual Rejection**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/loan/reject/user-123 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "rejectedBy": "manager-456",
  "reason": "Insufficient income documentation"
}'
```

**Expected Outcome:**
