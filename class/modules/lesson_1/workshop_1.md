# Workshop 1: Introduction to Temporal

## Building Your Foundation Understanding

*This lesson focuses on understanding, not coding*

---

# What we want to build

In this lesson, we won't be writing any code yet. Instead, we'll build a **solid understanding** of:

- 🧠 What Temporal is
- 🤔 Why it exists  
- 🔧 How it solves common problems in distributed systems

**Think of this as laying the foundation before we start building.**

---

# Expecting Result

## By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- ✅ **Explain** what Temporal is in simple terms
- ✅ **Understand** why traditional approaches are problematic
- ✅ **Identify** scenarios where Temporal would be beneficial
- ✅ **Recognize** key components of Temporal architecture
- ✅ **Feel confident** about why we're learning this technology

---

# Code Steps

## This lesson is purely conceptual - no coding required!

Instead, follow these **learning steps**:

---

# Step 1: Watch and Learn

**Read through the `concept.md` file** in this lesson to understand:

- 🔍 What problems Temporal solves
- ❌ How traditional approaches fall short
- 📚 Key Temporal concepts and terminology

**Take your time** - understanding these concepts will make everything else easier!

---

# Step 2: Think About Your Experience

## Consider these questions:

- 🤔 Have you ever built a system that needed to coordinate multiple services?
- 💥 Have you dealt with failures in long-running processes?
- 🔄 How did you handle retries, timeouts, or state management across services?

**Write down your answers** - we'll reference them throughout the course!

---

# Step 3: Identify Use Cases

## Think about scenarios where Temporal could help:

- 👤 **User onboarding flows** (email verification → profile setup → welcome sequence)
- 🛒 **Order processing** (payment → inventory → shipping → notifications)  
- 📊 **Data processing pipelines** (extract → transform → load → validate)
- 💳 **Subscription management** (trial → billing → renewals → cancellations)

---

# Step 4: Prepare Your Learning Environment

## Make sure you have these tools ready for upcoming lessons:

- ☕ **Java 21+** installed and configured
- 💻 **IntelliJ IDEA** or your preferred Kotlin IDE
- 🐳 **Docker Desktop** (we'll use this to run Temporal locally)
- 🖥️ **Terminal/Command Line** access
- 🔧 **Git** for version control

---

# How to Run

## Since this is a theory lesson, there's nothing to run!

**Instead:**

1. 📖 **Read the concept.md file carefully**
2. ✍️ **Take notes** on key concepts that are new to you
3. 💭 **Think about** how Temporal might apply to systems you've worked on
4. 🛠️ **Prepare your development environment** for the next lesson

---

# Quick Environment Check

## Verify you have everything ready:

```bash
# Check Java version
java -version

# Check Docker is running
docker --version

# Check if you can access Docker
docker ps
```

**Expected**: Java 21+, Docker running successfully

---

# 🎯 Your Learning Goals

## By the time you finish this lesson:

- ✅ You'll understand **why Temporal exists**
- ✅ You'll recognize **common distributed system problems**  
- ✅ You'll see **how Temporal solves these problems**
- ✅ You'll be **excited to start building**

---

# 🚀 Ready to Start?

**Start with the `concept.md` file** to build your foundational understanding of Temporal!

## Next Steps:
1. Read through all concept slides carefully
2. Think about how this applies to your experience
3. Prepare your development environment
4. Get ready for Lesson 2 where we start coding!

**Let's dive in! 📚**
