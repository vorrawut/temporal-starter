# Workshop 1: Introduction to Temporal

---

## What we want to build

In this lesson, we won't be writing any code yet. Instead, we'll build a solid understanding of what Temporal is, why it exists, and how it solves common problems in distributed systems. Think of this as laying the foundation before we start building.

---

## Expecting Result

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain what Temporal is in simple terms
- Understand why traditional approaches to distributed workflows are problematic
- Identify scenarios where Temporal would be beneficial
- Recognize the key components of the Temporal architecture
- Feel confident about why we're learning this technology

## Code Steps

This lesson is purely conceptual - no coding required! Instead, follow these learning steps:

### Step 1: Watch and Learn
Read through the `concept.md` file in this lesson to understand:
- What problems Temporal solves
- How traditional approaches fall short
- Key Temporal concepts and terminology

### Step 2: Think About Your Experience
Consider these questions:
- Have you ever built a system that needed to coordinate multiple services?
- Have you dealt with failures in long-running processes?
- How did you handle retries, timeouts, or state management across services?

### Step 3: Identify Use Cases
Think about scenarios where Temporal could help:
- User onboarding flows (email verification → profile setup → welcome sequence)
- Order processing (payment → inventory → shipping → notifications)
- Data processing pipelines (extract → transform → load → validate)
- Subscription management (trial → billing → renewals → cancellations)

### Step 4: Prepare Your Learning Environment
Make sure you have these tools ready for upcoming lessons:
- **Java 21+** installed and configured
- **IntelliJ IDEA** or your preferred Kotlin IDE
- **Docker Desktop** (we'll use this to run Temporal locally)
- **Terminal/Command Line** access
- **Git** for version control

## How to Run

Since this is a theory lesson, there's nothing to run! Instead:

1. **Read the concept.md file carefully**
2. **Take notes** on key concepts that are new to you
3. **Think about** how Temporal might apply to systems you've worked on
4. **Prepare your development environment** for the next lesson
