# Workshop 2: Kotlin + Spring Boot + Temporal Setup

## Building Your First Temporal Application

*Setting up the foundation - the plumbing for your Temporal workflows*

---

# What we want to build

A **basic Spring Boot application in Kotlin** that connects to Temporal. 

Think of this as creating the foundation - we're setting up the plumbing that will allow our application to communicate with Temporal, but we won't create any workflows yet.

---

# Expecting Result

## By the end of this lesson, you'll have:

- ‚úÖ **Spring Boot application** that starts successfully
- ‚úÖ **Temporal SDK dependencies** properly configured
- ‚úÖ **Temporal client** that connects to a local Temporal server
- ‚úÖ **Worker** ready to execute workflows (though we haven't written any yet)
- ‚úÖ **Console output** showing "‚úÖ Temporal worker started successfully!"

---

# Code Steps

## Step 1: Understand the Project Structure

Look at the starter code in `/src/workshop/lesson_2/`:

- üìÑ `TemporalBootcampApplication.kt` - Standard Spring Boot main class
- ‚öôÔ∏è `config/TemporalConfig.kt` - Empty configuration class with hints

**Note**: The Temporal dependencies are already added to `build.gradle.kts` for you.

---

# Step 2: Configure Temporal Connection

Open `src/workshop/lesson_2/config/TemporalConfig.kt` and add the necessary imports:

```kotlin
import io.temporal.client.WorkflowClient
import io.temporal.client.WorkflowClientOptions
import io.temporal.serviceclient.WorkflowServiceStubs
import io.temporal.serviceclient.WorkflowServiceStubsOptions
import io.temporal.worker.WorkerFactory
import mu.KotlinLogging
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy
```

---

# Step 3: Add Basic Properties

Inside the `TemporalConfig` class, add:

```kotlin
private val logger = KotlinLogging.logger {}
private lateinit var workerFactory: WorkerFactory
```

## **Purpose:**
- **Logger**: For tracking what's happening during startup
- **WorkerFactory**: Will manage workers that execute workflows

---

# Step 4: Create WorkflowServiceStubs Bean

This creates the **connection to Temporal server**:

```kotlin
@Bean
fun workflowServiceStubs(): WorkflowServiceStubs {
    logger.info { "Creating Temporal service stubs for local server" }
    return WorkflowServiceStubs.newLocalServiceStubs(
        WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.newBuilder()
            .build()
    )
}
```

**This is your connection to Temporal!**

---

# Step 5: Create WorkflowClient Bean

This provides the **API to interact with Temporal**:

```kotlin
@Bean
fun workflowClient(workflowServiceStubs: WorkflowServiceStubs): WorkflowClient {
    logger.info { "Creating Temporal workflow client" }
    return WorkflowClient.newInstance(
        workflowServiceStubs,
        WorkflowClientOptions.newBuilder()
            .build()
    )
}
```

**This is your remote control for workflows!**

---

# Step 6: Create WorkerFactory Bean

This **manages workers** that execute workflows:

```kotlin
@Bean
fun workerFactory(workflowClient: WorkflowClient): WorkerFactory {
    logger.info { "Creating Temporal worker factory" }
    workerFactory = WorkerFactory.newInstance(workflowClient)
    return workerFactory
}
```

**Workers are the engine that runs your code!**

---

# Step 7: Start the Worker

Add a method to **start the worker** after Spring finishes initializing:

```kotlin
@PostConstruct
fun startWorker() {
    logger.info { "Starting Temporal worker..." }
    
    // Create a worker for a test task queue
    val worker = workerFactory.newWorker("lesson2-test-queue")
    
    // Start the worker factory
    workerFactory.start()
    
    logger.info { "‚úÖ Temporal worker started successfully!" }
}
```

---

# Step 8: Add Graceful Shutdown

Add **cleanup** when the application stops:

```kotlin
@PreDestroy
fun shutdown() {
    logger.info { "Shutting down Temporal worker..." }
    workerFactory.shutdown()
    logger.info { "‚ùå Temporal worker stopped" }
}
```

**Always clean up resources properly!**

---

# How to Run

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This lesson requires Temporal server to be running locally. Since we haven't covered that yet, **expect connection errors for now**. That's completely normal!

---

# Option 1: From IDE

1. Open `TemporalBootcampApplication.kt`
2. Click the green arrow next to the `main` function
3. You should see the application start (but fail to connect to Temporal)

## **Expected**: Application starts but can't connect yet!

---

# Option 2: From Command Line

```bash
./gradlew bootRun --args="--spring.main.sources=com.temporal.workshop.lesson_2.TemporalBootcampApplication"
```

**This command tells Gradle to run your specific application class.**

---

# Expected Output (Without Temporal Server)

```
Creating Temporal service stubs for local server
Creating Temporal workflow client  
Creating Temporal worker factory
Starting Temporal worker...
ERROR: Connection refused (Temporal server not running)
```

**üéØ This is exactly what we expect right now!**

---

# Expected Output (With Temporal Server - Lesson 3)

```
Creating Temporal service stubs for local server
Creating Temporal workflow client
Creating Temporal worker factory  
Starting Temporal worker...
‚úÖ Temporal worker started successfully! Connected to local Temporal server.
```

**This is what you'll see in Lesson 3!**

---

# Troubleshooting

## **"Connection refused"**
- ‚úÖ This is expected! You need Temporal server running (covered in Lesson 3)

## **"Class not found"**
- ‚ùå Make sure all imports are correct

## **"Bean creation failed"**
- ‚ùå Check that all `@Bean` methods are properly annotated

---

# What You've Accomplished

## ‚úÖ **Achievements:**

- ‚úÖ **Set up the basic Temporal infrastructure** in Spring Boot
- ‚úÖ **Created the connection configuration** to Temporal server
- ‚úÖ **Prepared a worker** that's ready to execute workflows
- ‚úÖ **Added proper logging** and lifecycle management

---

# üöÄ Next Steps

**The foundation is ready!** 

## **In Lesson 3:**
- Start the Temporal server
- See this connection come alive
- Access the Temporal Web UI
- Watch your worker connect successfully

**Ready to start Temporal server? Let's go! üéâ**
