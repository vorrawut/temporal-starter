# Workshop 3: Run Temporal Locally

## Starting the Engine for Your Workflows

*Get Temporal server running and connect your Spring Boot application*

---

# What we want to build

In this lesson, we'll get **Temporal server running** on your local machine and connect our Spring Boot application to it. 

Think of this as **starting up the engine** that will power all our workflows.

---

# Expecting Result

## By the end of this lesson, you'll have:

- âœ… **Temporal CLI** installed and working
- âœ… **Temporal server** running locally on your machine
- âœ… **Spring Boot application** successfully connecting to Temporal
- âœ… **Access to Temporal Web UI** for monitoring workflows
- âœ… **Console output** showing "âœ… Temporal worker started successfully!"

---

# Code Steps

**This lesson doesn't require writing new code**, but rather setting up the Temporal infrastructure and testing our existing code.

---

# Step 1: Install Temporal CLI

The **Temporal CLI** provides tools to run the server and manage workflows.

## **For macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install temporal
```

## **For Linux/WSL:**
```bash
curl -sSf https://temporal.download/cli.sh | sh
```

---

# More Installation Options

## **For Windows:**
Download the latest release from: 
https://github.com/temporalio/cli/releases

## **Verify Installation:**
```bash
temporal --version
```

**You should see something like:**
```
temporal version 0.10.0
```

---

# Step 2: Start Temporal Server

The `temporal server start-dev` command starts a **complete Temporal environment** suitable for development.

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

**Keep this terminal window open** - the server runs in the foreground.

---

# Expected Server Output

```
temporal server start-dev
Starting Temporal Server...

Server:  localhost:7233
UI:      http://localhost:8233
Metrics: http://localhost:7234/metrics

Started Temporal Server.
```

**ðŸŽ‰ Success! Your Temporal server is running!**

---

# What `start-dev` Provides

## **Complete Development Environment:**
- âœ… **Temporal server** (orchestration engine)
- âœ… **Web UI** for monitoring workflows
- âœ… **SQLite database** for persistence
- âœ… **Default namespace** configuration

**Everything you need for development in one command!**

---

# Step 3: Verify Temporal Web UI

**Open your browser** and go to: **http://localhost:8233**

## **You should see:**
- âœ… **Navigation sidebar**
- âœ… **"No workflows found"** message (this is normal!)
- âœ… **Various tabs**: Workflows, Schedules, Task Queues, etc.

**If you see this, Temporal is working perfectly!**

---

# Step 4: Test Your Spring Boot Connection

Now let's see if your **Lesson 2 application** can connect to Temporal!

## **Option 1: Run from IDE**
1. Open your Lesson 2 project in your IDE
2. Run `TemporalBootcampApplication.kt`
3. Watch the console output

## **Option 2: Run from Command Line**
```bash
./gradlew bootRun --args="--spring.main.sources=com.temporal.workshop.lesson_2.TemporalBootcampApplication"
```

---

# Step 5: Verify Successful Connection

**You should see console output like:**

```
Creating Temporal service stubs for local server
Creating Temporal workflow client
Creating Temporal worker factory
Starting Temporal worker...
âœ… Temporal worker started successfully! Connected to local Temporal server.
```

**ðŸŽ‰ If you see this, everything is working!**

---

# Step 6: Check Workers in Web UI

1. **Go back to Temporal Web UI**: http://localhost:8233
2. **Click on "Workers"** in the left sidebar
3. **You should see your worker listed:**
   - **Task Queue**: `lesson2-test-queue`
   - **Identity**: Your computer's hostname + some ID
   - **Status**: Should be green/healthy

**Your worker is now registered and ready!**

---

# Step 7: Explore the Web UI

Take a few minutes to explore the different sections:

## **Workflows Tab**
- Currently empty (we haven't created workflows yet)
- This is where you'll see workflow executions

## **Task Queues Tab**
- Should show `lesson2-test-queue` with 1 worker
- Shows worker health and activity

---

# More Web UI Sections

## **Namespaces Tab**
- Shows the `default` namespace we're using
- In production, you might have separate namespaces for different environments

## **Settings**
- Configuration options for the Web UI
- Data encoding settings

**Explore and get familiar with the interface!**

---

# Daily Development Workflow

## **For future lessons, this will be your typical workflow:**

### **Terminal 1:**
```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

### **Terminal 2:**
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

### **Browser:**
Open: http://localhost:8233

---

# Stopping Everything

## **To stop cleanly:**

1. **Stop your Spring Boot application** (Ctrl+C or stop in IDE)
2. **Stop Temporal server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

**Always stop in this order for clean shutdown!**

---

# Troubleshooting

## **"Command 'temporal' not found"**
- Make sure you installed the CLI correctly
- Try restarting your terminal
- On macOS, try `brew install temporal` again

## **"Port 7233 already in use"**
- You might have another Temporal server running
- Kill any existing processes: `pkill temporal`
- Try starting again

---

# More Troubleshooting

## **"Connection refused" in Spring Boot**
- Make sure Temporal server is running (`temporal server start-dev`)
- Check that you see "Started Temporal Server" in the server output
- Verify the server is on localhost:7233

## **Spring Boot can't connect but server is running**
- Check your `TemporalConfig.kt` configuration
- Make sure you're using `newLocalServiceStubs()` for local development
- Verify all imports are correct

---

# Final Troubleshooting

## **Web UI doesn't load**
- Make sure you're going to http://localhost:8233 (not 7233)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that no other service is using port 8233

**When in doubt, restart everything!**

---

# What You've Accomplished

## âœ… **Major Achievements:**

- âœ… **Installed Temporal CLI** for managing Temporal environments
- âœ… **Started a local Temporal server** for development
- âœ… **Connected your Spring Boot application** to Temporal successfully
- âœ… **Verified the connection** using the Temporal Web UI
- âœ… **Explored the monitoring** and management interface
- âœ… **Set up a complete development environment** for Temporal workflows

---

# ðŸš€ Next Steps
