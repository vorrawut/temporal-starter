# Lesson 3 Complete Solution

Lesson 3 focuses on running Temporal server and testing connections, so there are no code changes from Lesson 2.

## What Was Accomplished

- ✅ Installed Temporal CLI
- ✅ Started local Temporal server with `temporal server start-dev`
- ✅ Confirmed Spring Boot application connects successfully
- ✅ Explored Temporal Web UI

## Verification

Your setup is working correctly if:

1. **Temporal server starts without errors**:
   ```bash
   temporal server start-dev
   ```

2. **Web UI is accessible**: http://localhost:8233

3. **Spring Boot app connects successfully**:
   ```
   ✅ Temporal worker started successfully! Connected to local Temporal server.
   ```

4. **Worker appears in Web UI**: Check the "Workers" section

- **Temporal server**: localhost:7233 (default)
- **Web UI**: localhost:8233 (default)
- **Namespace**: default
- **Task queue**: lesson2-test-queue
