# Workshop 5 Starter Code

This lesson focuses on creating a simple workflow that calls an activity to perform basic calculations.

## What's Provided

- `workflow/CalculatorWorkflow.kt` - Empty workflow interface with TODO comments
- `workflow/CalculatorWorkflowImpl.kt` - Empty workflow implementation with TODO comments
- `activity/MathActivity.kt` - Empty activity interface with TODO comments  
- `activity/MathActivityImpl.kt` - Empty activity implementation with TODO comments

## What You Need To Do

Follow the instructions in `../modules/lesson_5/workshop_5.md` to:

1. Create the workflow interface and implementation
2. Create the activity interface and implementation
3. Set up a simple math operation that logs its work

## Goal

Create a working workflow that:
- Takes two numbers as input
- Calls an activity to add them
- Returns the result
- Logs the operation for learning purposes

This builds on previous lessons by showing the basic workflow â†’ activity pattern in action.
