# Lesson 17: Deployment & Production Infrastructure - Workshop

## Overview

This final lesson of the Temporal Workflow bootcamp focuses on deploying your Temporal applications to production-like environments using Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes. You'll learn how to containerize your application, manage configuration, and deploy at scale.

## What You'll Learn

- Containerizing Spring Boot applications with Docker
- Multi-stage builds for optimized container images
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Production deployment with Kubernetes
- Configuration management and secrets handling
- Health checks and monitoring setup
- Scaling strategies and best practices

## Your Task

Complete the production deployment setup by implementing:

1. **Production-Ready Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with security best practices
2. **Docker Compose Configuration**: Complete stack with Temporal server, database, and your application
3. **Kubernetes Manifests**: Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, and Secret configurations
4. **Environment Configuration**: Proper separation of environment-specific settings
5. **Health Checks**: Application and container health monitoring
6. **Helm Chart** (Optional): Package management for Kubernetes deployments

## Key Requirements

- Use multi-stage Docker builds for efficiency
- Implement proper security practices (non-root user, minimal base images)
- Configure health checks at application and container levels
- Separate configuration from secrets
- Include resource limits and requests
- Implement proper scaling strategies
- Follow container orchestration best practices

## Files to Work With

- `docker-compose.yaml` - Complete the Docker Compose configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Build a production-ready container image
- `k8s/` directory - Complete the Kubernetes manifests
- `env.example` - Environment configuration template
- Follow the TODO comments to implement each section

## Success Criteria

Your implementation should demonstrate:

- âœ… Working Docker Compose stack with all services
- âœ… Optimized Docker image with security best practices
- âœ… Complete Kubernetes deployment manifests
- âœ… Proper configuration and secrets management
- âœ… Health checks and monitoring endpoints
- âœ… Resource management and scaling configuration
- âœ… Production-ready deployment patterns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:
- Docker and Docker Compose
- kubectl (for Kubernetes deployment)
- Helm (optional, for Helm chart deployment)
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud)

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Start with Docker**: Complete the Dockerfile with multi-stage build
2. **Local Development**: Set up Docker Compose for the complete stack
3. **Kubernetes Basics**: Create basic deployment and service manifests
4. **Configuration**: Add ConfigMaps and Secrets for proper configuration management
5. **Advanced Features**: Add health checks, resource limits, and scaling
6. **Monitoring**: Configure Prometheus metrics and logging
7. **Helm Chart** (Optional): Package everything in a Helm chart

### Testing Your Implementation

#### Docker Compose Testing
```bash
# Build and start the stack
docker compose up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker compose ps

# Check application health
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health

# Access Temporal Web UI
open http://localhost:8088

# View logs
docker compose logs temporal-worker
```

#### Kubernetes Testing
```bash
# Apply all manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/ -n temporal-system

# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods -n temporal-system
kubectl get svc -n temporal-system

# Port forward to access application
kubectl port-forward svc/temporal-worker-service 8080:8080 -n temporal-system

# Check application health
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Docker Issues
- **Build failures**: Check Gradle wrapper permissions and dependencies
- **Connection refused**: Ensure services are healthy before dependents start
- **Port conflicts**: Check if ports 7233, 8080, 8081, 8088 are available

#### Kubernetes Issues
- **ImagePullBackOff**: Ensure Docker image is built and tagged correctly
- **CrashLoopBackOff**: Check application logs and health check configuration
- **Service not accessible**: Verify service selectors match pod labels

#### Configuration Issues
- **Environment variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set
- **Secrets**: Verify secrets are created and properly referenced
- **ConfigMaps**: Check ConfigMap data is correctly mounted

## Production Considerations

When implementing, consider:

- **Security**: Use non-root users, scan images for vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Optimize JVM settings for containers
- **Monitoring**: Include comprehensive health checks and metrics
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling
- **Reliability**: Implement proper restart policies and resource limits
- **Maintainability**: Use clear naming conventions and documentation

## Next Steps

After completing this lesson, you'll have:
- A complete understanding of containerized Temporal deployments
- Production-ready infrastructure as code
- Experience with container orchestration platforms
- Knowledge of deployment best practices and security considerations

**Congratulations!** You've now mastered the complete Temporal Workflow development lifecycle from basic concepts to production deployment! ðŸŽ‰
