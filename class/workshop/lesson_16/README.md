# Lesson 16: Testing + Production Readiness - Workshop

## Overview

This final lesson of the Temporal Workflow bootcamp focuses on comprehensive testing strategies and production deployment patterns. You'll learn how to write effective tests for workflows and activities, configure production-ready workers, and implement monitoring and operational best practices.

## What You'll Learn

- Unit testing workflows using `TestWorkflowRule`
- Creating mock activity implementations for testing
- Integration testing patterns with real Temporal servers
- Production worker configuration and scaling
- Error handling and compensation patterns
- Monitoring, metrics, and observability
- Deployment strategies and operational excellence

## Your Task

Complete the comprehensive testing and production setup by implementing:

1. **Rich Data Models**: Define complex data structures that support both testing and production scenarios
2. **Activity Interfaces**: Create testable activity interfaces with proper separation of concerns
3. **Mock Implementations**: Build configurable mock activities for testing various scenarios
4. **Test Framework**: Implement `TestWorkflowRule`-based testing infrastructure
5. **Production Configuration**: Set up worker configuration, timeouts, and retry policies
6. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with compensation logic
7. **Monitoring**: Add logging, metrics, and health checks

## Key Requirements

- Use `TestWorkflowRule` for isolated workflow testing
- Create both mock and production activity implementations
- Configure different activity options for different operation types
- Implement comprehensive error handling with compensation
- Add proper logging and monitoring patterns
- Include production-ready worker configuration
- Design for scalability and operational excellence

## Files to Work With

- `workflow/TestableWorkflow.kt` - Main workflow and supporting classes
- Follow the TODO comments to implement each section
- Create both unit tests and integration tests
- Reference the concept documentation for production patterns

## Testing Strategy

Your implementation should include tests for:

### **Unit Tests**
- ✅ Happy path scenarios (all operations succeed)
- ✅ Validation failures and error handling
- ✅ Partial failures with compensation logic
- ✅ Timeout and retry behavior
- ✅ Different order priorities and configurations

### **Integration Tests**
- ✅ End-to-end workflow execution
- ✅ External service failure scenarios
- ✅ Load testing with concurrent executions
- ✅ Performance benchmarking

### **Production Tests**
- ✅ Worker configuration validation
- ✅ Health check functionality
- ✅ Metrics collection verification
- ✅ Deployment scenario testing

## Success Criteria

Your implementation should demonstrate:

- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all workflow paths
- ✅ Configurable mock activities that can simulate various scenarios
- ✅ Production-ready worker configuration with proper scaling
- ✅ Robust error handling with compensation patterns
- ✅ Monitoring and observability integration
- ✅ Clear separation between test and production code
- ✅ Documentation of deployment and operational procedures

## Production Considerations

When implementing, consider:

- **Scalability**: How will the system handle increased load?
- **Reliability**: What happens when external services fail?
- **Monitoring**: How will you detect and diagnose issues?
- **Security**: How are credentials and sensitive data handled?
- **Deployment**: How do you safely deploy changes?
- **Maintenance**: How do you handle upgrades and migrations?

## Next Steps

After completing this lesson, you'll have:
- A complete understanding of Temporal workflow testing strategies
- Production-ready deployment patterns and configurations
- Operational best practices for maintaining Temporal workflows
- The skills to design and implement robust, scalable workflow systems

This completes the 16-lesson Temporal Workflow bootcamp. You're now ready to build and deploy production-grade Temporal applications!
