# Lesson 2 Complete Solution

This folder contains the complete solution for Lesson 2: Kotlin + Spring Boot + Temporal Setup.

## What's Included

- `TemporalStarterApplication.kt` - Spring Boot main class
- `config/TemporalConfig.kt` - Complete Temporal configuration with:
  - Connection to local Temporal server
  - Workflow client setup
  - Worker factory configuration
  - Basic worker that connects to a test queue

## How It Works

1. **WorkflowServiceStubs** - Connects to Temporal server (localhost:7233 by default)
2. **WorkflowClient** - Provides the interface to start workflows and interact with Temporal
3. **WorkerFactory** - Creates and manages workers that execute workflows and activities
4. **Worker** - Listens to a specific task queue for work to execute

## Running This Solution

Make sure you have Temporal server running locally (see Lesson 3),
then you should see output like:
```
âœ… Temporal worker started successfully! Connected to local Temporal server.
```

## Key Learning Points

- Temporal configuration uses Spring beans for dependency injection
- Workers must be started after configuration is complete
- Graceful shutdown ensures workers stop cleanly
- The worker factory manages multiple workers efficiently

## Next Steps

In Lesson 3, we'll learn how to run Temporal server locally and see this connection in action!
