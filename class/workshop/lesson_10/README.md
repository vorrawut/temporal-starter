# Workshop 10 Starter Code

## Interactive Workflows with Signals and Queries

*This lesson focuses on interactive workflows using signals and queries for real-time communication*

---

# What's Provided

## **Starter Materials:**

- âœ… `workflow/ApprovalWorkflow.kt` - Starter interface with signal/query templates
- âœ… **Basic data classes** for approval requests and results
- âœ… **Template structure** for implementing interactive patterns

---

# What You Need To Do

## Follow the instructions in `../modules/lesson_10/workshop_10.md` to:

1. âœ… **Implement the ApprovalWorkflow interface** with signals and queries
2. âœ… **Create workflow implementation** that maintains state
3. âœ… **Handle signal methods** for approve/reject actions
4. âœ… **Implement query methods** for status checking
5. âœ… **Add timeout handling** and external integration patterns

---

# Goal

## Create a workflow that:

- âœ… **Responds to external signals** in real-time
- âœ… **Provides queryable state information**
- âœ… **Handles long-running approval processes**
- âœ… **Supports timeout and escalation patterns**
- âœ… **Integrates with external systems** via REST APIs

---

# Architecture Focus

## This lesson emphasizes:

- âœ… **Signal vs query patterns** - when to use each
- âœ… **Long-running workflow management** 
- âœ… **External system integration**
- âœ… **State management and caching**
- âœ… **Interactive workflow patterns** for real-time systems
